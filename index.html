            <h2>Section 1: Identification of attack</h2>
            <p>
                Analysis of the Wireshark TCP/HTTP logs indicates that the downtime was caused by a malicious TCP SYN flood attack from IP address 
                <span class="mono">203.0.113.0</span>. While normal requests from authorized users were still observed, the logs show a growing volume of SYN packets from the attacker, eventually saturating server connection slots and causing service interruption.

            <h3>TCP Three-Way Handshake Explained</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>SYN (Synchronize) – The client (device) sends a SYN packet to the server, requesting to start a TCP connection.</li>
                <li>SYN-ACK (Synchronize-Acknowledge) – The server responds with a SYN-ACK packet, acknowledging the client’s request and signaling readiness to establish the connection.</li>
                <li>ACK (Acknowledge) – The client sends an ACK packet back to the server, completing the handshake and opening the TCP connection for data transfer.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Effect of SYN Flood</h3>
            <p>
                A high volume of SYN packets from the attacker occupies the server’s half-open connection table, preventing legitimate TCP handshake requests from completing. 
                This resource exhaustion can result in denial of service for legitimate users.
            </p>

            <h3>Log Analysis</h3>
            <p>
                Log analysis confirms that the attacker’s SYN packets from 
                <span class="mono">203.0.113.0</span> prevented legitimate TCP connections from completing, leading to temporary service unavailability.
